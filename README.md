# Digital-Counter-using-Verilog-and-FPGA
A Verilog-based digital stopwatch for FPGA with millisecond accuracy. It uses an FSM for control (start, pause, reset) and counters for timekeeping, displaying minutes, seconds, and milliseconds on six 7-segment displays. A modular design for learning digital logic and HDL.
